Hey,

The quantitative aptitude section is asked to check your problem-solving skills and how well you can handle data. The time-limit in the section is to see your performance under time-constraints and pressure.

Almost all the companies have an aptitude section in their hiring test and the most important/frequently asked topics can be:

Probability
Permutations and Combinations
Divisibility
Algebra
Equations
Profit & Loss
Work & Time
Problem on Ages
Averages, etc
The topics are the same for all the companies but every company has a particular domain and you must be aware of that domain before you start preparing so that you practice accordingly. The best approach is to study company-wise and topic-wise and for this, I will suggest you go for PrepInsta Royal Pass as this is an overall-campus placement guide with study material of 20+ companies. It has pre-recorded lectures that teach you everything from scratch and the practice questions help you strengthen the concepts.
